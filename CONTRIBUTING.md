8. Open a Pull Request

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Redis server
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Instructions
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-system.git
cd cybersecurity-system

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Start Redis (if not already running)
redis-server
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Security check
bandit -r src/
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization
- Place new modules in appropriate directories under `src/`
- Add `__init__.py` files to make directories Python packages
- Keep imports organized (standard library, third-party, local)
- Use relative imports within the project

### Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Update API documentation in `docs/API.md` for API changes
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
